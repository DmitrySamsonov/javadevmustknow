is a programming technique for converting data
between relational databases and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc.


An ORM system has the following advantages over plain JDBC −

Sr.No.	   Advantages
1	      Let’s business code access objects rather than DB tables.
2	      Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
3	      Based on JDBC 'under the hood.'
4	      No need to deal with the database implementation.
5	      Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure.
6	      Transaction management and automatic key generation.
7	      Fast development of application.


An ORM solution consists of the following four entities −

Sr.No.	   Solutions
1	      An API to perform basic CRUD operations on objects of persistent classes.
2	      A language or API to specify queries that refer to classes and properties of classes.
3	      A configurable facility for specifying mapping metadata.
4	      A technique to interact with transactional objects to perform dirty checking, lazy association fetching, and other optimization functions.
