Type 3: JDBC-Net pure Java


In a Type 3 driver,
a three-tier approach is used to access databases.

The JDBC clients use standard network sockets to communicate with a middleware application server.

The socket information is then translated by the middleware application server
into the call format required by the DBMS,
and forwarded to the database server.


This kind of driver is extremely flexible,
since it requires no code installed on the client
and a single driver can actually provide access to multiple databases.
