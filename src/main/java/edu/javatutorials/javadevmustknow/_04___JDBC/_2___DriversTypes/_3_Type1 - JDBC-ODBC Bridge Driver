Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver


In a Type 1 driver,
a JDBC bridge is used to access ODBC drivers
installed on each client machine.

Using ODBC, requires configuring on your system a Data Source Name (DSN)
that represents the target database.

When Java first came out, this was a useful driver
because most databases only supported ODBC access
but now this type of driver is recommended only for experimental use
or when no other alternative is available.
