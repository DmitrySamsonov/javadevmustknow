First problem,
what if we need to modify the design of our database after having developed a few pages or our application?


Second,
loading and storing objects in a relational database exposes us to the following five mismatch problems âˆ’


1. Granularity
Sometimes you will have an object model, which has more classes than the number of corresponding tables in the database.

2. Inheritance
RDBMSs do not define anything similar to Inheritance, which is a natural paradigm in object-oriented programming languages.

3. Identity
An RDBMS defines exactly one notion of 'sameness': the primary key.
Java, however, defines both object identity (a==b) and object equality (a.equals(b)).

4. Associations
Object-oriented languages represent associations using object references whereas an RDBMS represents an association as a foreign key column.

5. Navigation
The ways you access objects in Java and in RDBMS are fundamentally different.




The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
is the solution to handle all the above impedance mismatches.
