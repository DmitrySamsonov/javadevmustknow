After you've installed the appropriate driver, 
it is time to establish a database connection using JDBC.

The programming involved to establish a JDBC connection is fairly simple. 
Here are these simple four steps âˆ’

1. Import JDBC Packages: 
   Add import statements to your Java program to import required classes in your Java code.

2. Register JDBC Driver: 
   This step causes the JVM to load the desired driver implementation into memory so it can fulfill your JDBC requests.

3. Database URL Formulation: 
   This is to create a properly formatted address that points to the database to which you wish to connect.

4. Create Connection Object: 
   Finally, code a call to the DriverManager object's getConnection( ) method to establish actual database connection.
