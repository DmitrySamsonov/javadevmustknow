Why ORM (Object Relational Mapping)?


When we work with an object-oriented system,
there is a mismatch between the object model and the relational database.

RDBMSs represent data in a tabular format 
whereas object-oriented languages, such as Java or C#
represent it as an interconnected graph of objects.
