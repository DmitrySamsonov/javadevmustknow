What is a NULL value?

A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank,
which means a field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

It is very important to understand
that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces.
A field with a NULL value is the one that has been left blank during a record creation.
