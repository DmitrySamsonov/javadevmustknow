Type 2: JDBC-Native API


In a Type 2 driver,
JDBC API calls are converted into native C/C++ API calls,
which are unique to the database.

These drivers are typically provided by the database vendors
and used in the same manner as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.
The vendor-specific driver must be installed on each client machine.


If we change the Database, we have to change the native API,
as it is specific to a database and they are mostly obsolete now,
but you may realize some speed increase with a Type 2 driver, because it eliminates ODBC's overhead.


The Oracle Call Interface (OCI) driver is an example of a Type 2 driver.
