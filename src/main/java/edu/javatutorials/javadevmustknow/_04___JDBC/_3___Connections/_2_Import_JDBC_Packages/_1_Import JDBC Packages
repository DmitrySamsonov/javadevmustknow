Import JDBC Packages

The Import statements tell the Java compiler
where to find the classes you reference in your code
and are placed at the very beginning of your source code.

To use the standard JDBC package,
which allows you to select, insert, update, and delete data in SQL tables,
add the following imports to your source code âˆ’

import java.sql.* ;  // for standard JDBC programs
import java.math.* ; // for BigDecimal and BigInteger support
