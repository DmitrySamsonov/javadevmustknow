Type 4: 100% Pure Java


In a Type 4 driver,
a pure Java-based driver communicates directly with the vendor's database through socket connection.

This is the highest performance driver available for the database
and is usually provided by the vendor itself.


This kind of driver is extremely flexible,
you don't need to install special software on the client or server.
Further, these drivers can be downloaded dynamically.


MySQL's Connector/J driver is a Type 4 driver.

Because of the proprietary nature of their network protocols,
database vendors usually supply type 4 drivers.
