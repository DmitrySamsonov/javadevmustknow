Transaction Object


A Transaction represents a unit of work with the database
and most of the RDBMS supports transaction functionality.

Transactions in Hibernate are handled by
an underlying transaction manager and transaction (from JDBC or JTA).

This is an optional object
and Hibernate applications may choose not to use this interface,
instead managing transactions in their own application code.
