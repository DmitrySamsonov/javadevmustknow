<<<<    NOT NULL Constraint   >>>>


By default, a column can hold NULL values.


If you do not want a column to have a NULL value,
then you need to define such a constraint on this column
specifying that NULL is now not allowed for that column.


A NULL is not the same as no data, rather, it represents unknown data.


Example
For example, the following SQL query creates a new table called CUSTOMERS
and adds five columns,
three of which, are ID NAME and AGE,
In this we specify not to accept NULLs âˆ’

CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);


If CUSTOMERS table has already been created,
then to add a NOT NULL constraint to the SALARY column in Oracle and MySQL,
you would write a query like the one that is shown in the following code block.

ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS
   MODIFY SALARY  DECIMAL (18, 2) NOT NULL;
