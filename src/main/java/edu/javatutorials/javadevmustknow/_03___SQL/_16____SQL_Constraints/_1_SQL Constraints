SQL Constraints  (Constraints - Ограничения)


Constraints are the rules enforced on data columns on a table.


These are used to limit the type of data
that can go into a table.

This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.


Constraints can either be column level or table level.
Column level constraints are applied only to one column
whereas, table level constraints are applied to the entire table.



Following are some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL −

• NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

• DEFAULT Constraint − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

• UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all the values in a column are different.

• PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

• FOREIGN Key − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any another database table.

• CHECK Constraint − The CHECK constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy certain conditions.

• INDEX − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.
