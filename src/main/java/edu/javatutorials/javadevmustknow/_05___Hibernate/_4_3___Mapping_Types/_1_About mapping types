About mapping types


When you prepare a Hibernate mapping document, you find
that you map the Java data types into RDBMS data types.

The types declared and used in the mapping files
are not Java data types;
they are not SQL database types either.


These types are called Hibernate mapping types, which can translate from Java to SQL data types and vice versa.
