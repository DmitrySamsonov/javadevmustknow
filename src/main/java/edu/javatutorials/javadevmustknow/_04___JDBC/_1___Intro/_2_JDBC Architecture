JDBC Architecture


The JDBC API supports both two-tier and three-tier processing models for database access
but in general, JDBC Architecture consists of two layers −


JDBC API:
    This provides the application-to-JDBC Manager connection.

The JDBC API uses a driver manager and database-specific drivers
to provide transparent connectivity to heterogeneous databases.



JDBC Driver API:
    This supports the JDBC Manager-to-Driver Connection.

The JDBC driver manager ensures
that the correct driver is used to access each data source.
The driver manager is capable of supporting multiple concurrent drivers
connected to multiple heterogeneous databases.

with respect to the JDBC drivers and the Java application −
