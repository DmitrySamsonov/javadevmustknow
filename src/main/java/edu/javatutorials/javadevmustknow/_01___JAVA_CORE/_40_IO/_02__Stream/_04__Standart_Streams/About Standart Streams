Standard Streams


All the programming languages provide support for standard I/O
where the person's program can take input from a keyboard and then produce an output on the computer screen.

If you are aware of C or C++ programming languages,
then you must be aware of three standard devices STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR.


Similarly, Java provides the following three standard streams −

1.      Standard Input  −   This is used to feed the data to person's program
                            and usually a keyboard is used as standard input stream
                            and represented as System.in.

2.      Standard Output −   This is used to output the data produced by the person's program
                            and usually a computer screen is used for standard output stream
                            and represented as System.out.

3.      Standard Error  −   This is used to output the error data
                            produced by the person's program
                            and usually a computer screen is used for standard error stream
                            and represented as System.err.
