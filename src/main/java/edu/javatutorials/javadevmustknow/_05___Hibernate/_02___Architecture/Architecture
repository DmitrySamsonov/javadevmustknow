Architecture

Hibernate has a layered architecture
which helps the person to operate without having to know the underlying APIs.

Hibernate makes use of the database and configuration data
to provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.



Hibernate uses various existing Java APIs,
like JDBC, Java Transaction API(JTA), and Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI).

JDBC provides a rudimentary level of abstraction of functionality common to relational databases,
allowing almost any database with a JDBC driver to be supported by Hibernate.

JNDI and JTA allow Hibernate to be integrated with J2EE application servers.
